INRODUCTION.
Inflation affects the currency of a country in various ways and lead to negative outcomes most times. In the following project, we look to see which features affect the inflation rate of Kenyan currency against other currencies and by how much and predict how these features can be reduced and by how much in order to reduce the adverse effects inflation is causing for the Kenyan shilling. Some of the negative effectsâ€™ inflation causes include:
Inflation erodes the purchasing power of a currency over time. If the inflation rate in Kenya is higher than the interest rates offered in savings accounts or investments, the real value of money decreases. It means that the same amount of money buys fewer goods and services reducing the standard of living for people.
High inflation can lead to depreciation of the Kenyan shilling against other currencies. When the domestic inflation rate is higher than that of its trading partners, Kenyan goods and services become more expensive compare to foreign alternatives. This can impact imports, exports and overall trade balance.
To combat inflation, central banks may raise interest rates which can influence borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Higher interest rates can lead to reduced borrowing and spending which may slow down economic growth.
Rising inflation can increase the cost of essential goods and services affecting householdsâ€™ cost of living. This puts pressure on peopleâ€™s budgets and living standards.
High and unpredictable inflation can deter foreign and local investments. Investors prefer stable economies with manageable inflation rates to make sound investment decisions.
These among others are the negative effects of inflation on a countryâ€™s economic growth progress. This project aims to predict how inflation has affected the Kenyan shilling against other currencies overtime while using various predictors and the Gross Domestic Product as the target variable to see how the predictors affect the target variable over time. The datasets used were sourced from CBK.



Problem Statement:

The economic stability and growth of Kenya heavily depend on various macroeconomic factors, with inflation and exchange rates being two critical determinants that significantly influence the fluctuations in the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). To ensure informed policy-making and efficient economic management, there is a pressing need to develop a robust predictive model capable of analysing the relationship between inflation, exchange rates, and Kenya's GDP fluctuations.

The problem at hand involves the following key challenges:

1. Identifying Complex Interdependencies: Inflation and exchange rates exhibit intricate and dynamic relationships with the economy, including possible lag effects and non-linear interactions. Developing a predictive model that effectively captures these complex interdependencies and provides accurate insights into the influence of inflation and exchange rates on GDP fluctuations is crucial.

2. Data Availability and Quality: Obtaining relevant and high-quality data is critical for building an accurate predictive model. The project takes comprehensive historical data on Kenya's GDP, inflation rates, and exchange rates spanning several years, sourced from the Central Bank of Kenya website.

3. Feature Selection and Engineering: Selecting the most relevant features and engineering appropriate indicators to represent inflation and exchange rate variations is vital for the model's success. Furthermore, integrating other relevant macroeconomic indicators, such as interest rates, fiscal policies, and external trade, might enhance the model's predictive power.

4. Model Robustness and Accuracy: Developing a robust predictive model that can handle different economic scenarios and accurately forecast GDP fluctuations based on inflation and exchange rate fluctuations is a significant challenge. The model should be capable of providing both short-term and long-term predictions with acceptable levels of accuracy.

5. Policy Implications: The predictive model should offer actionable insights that policy-makers, financial institutions, and businesses can use to anticipate and respond to potential economic challenges caused by fluctuations in inflation and exchange rates. The model's results should provide a basis for formulating effective monetary and fiscal policies to mitigate adverse effects on the economy.

6. Generalizability: While the model aims to analyse the specific case of Kenya's economy, ensuring its generalizability to other developing economies with similar characteristics is desirable. The model's design and methodologies should consider potential adaptability to different regions or countries facing comparable economic challenges.


Research Questions
1. How does inflation affect Kenya's GDP fluctuations, and what is the nature of the relationship between inflation and GDP growth?

2. What is the influence of exchange rate fluctuations on Kenya's GDP, and how do exchange rates interact with GDP movements over time?

3. Are there any lag effects between changes in inflation, exchange rates, and subsequent GDP fluctuations in Kenya?

4. How can a predictive model be developed to accurately forecast short-term and long-term GDP fluctuations based on inflation and exchange rate data?

5. How sensitive is the predictive model to different economic scenarios, and how reliable are its predictions under varying conditions?

6. Can the predictive model be used as a tool to identify potential economic challenges and vulnerabilities arising from inflation and exchange rate movements, and how can it assist in devising effective policy responses?

7. How well does the predictive model perform in capturing the complex interdependencies between inflation, exchange rates, and Kenya's GDP fluctuations, and how does it compare to other existing forecasting methods?
